##this powershell script automatically scans a preconfigured set of dirs for forbidden file names. 
##If a forbidden name is found, a notification is displayed to the user prompting them to change the filename or contact their admin.
##you can use an administration platform like INTUNE to push this out to client devices and run it on a regular schedule.
